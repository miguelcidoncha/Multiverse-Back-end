## Project Description 🚀

Multiverse is an e-commerce website designed to effectively sell merchandise products and provide customers with a satisfying shopping experience. It's a design and development project with a free theme in which we will be working on both the Front-end and Back-end. This repository contains the Front-end files along with the development of a fake API that allows us to work on the application without relying on real data or external system connections.

## Technologies and Tools 🔨

## Methodology 📚

● Mob, pair and solo programming <br>
● Agile with Scrum & Trello <br>
● Testing <br>
● We work with branches: 4 working branches were used on GitHub to manage the workflow: <br>
- Main: This branch contains functional and stable code. It is the main and/or final branch. <br>
- Dev: It's the branch where different working codes are integrated into one and where preliminary testing is done before production. It's an intermediate and/or safety branch. <br>
- Independents: These are different branches where each team member develops their code according to assigned tasks for later merging into the Dev branch. It's an independent and/or testing branch. <br>
+ The branch methodology allows us to work collaboratively and maintain an organized and efficient workflow. Furthermore, working in branches allows us to work freely without conflicting with the work of other team members. Additionally, it provides us with greater control and a record or history of the various changes being made. On the other hand, for added security when merging codes from different branches, we have implemented security rules on GitHub where it is necessary to create a pull request prior to the merge.
